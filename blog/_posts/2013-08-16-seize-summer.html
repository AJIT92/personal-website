<p>Throughout college I've maintained a giant spreadsheet detailing my daily activities in fifteen minute intervals, which is how I know that I spent an average 8.9 hours per day sitting in my bedroom doing assignments, studying, and working on research during the final four weeks of the past spring semester.</p>
<p>Long hours are actually rather tolerable once you appreciate the value of your time. As an extended experiment in not slacking off, I decided to see how much stuff I could get done over what would possibly be my last summer break.</p>

<h2>Internship</h2>
<p>I spent a very pleasant twelve weeks as a software development intern at Epic Systems, a health informatics company that puts out a huge software suite used by hospitals and clinics serving 47% of the American population. My office enjoyed one of the better views on campus.</p>

<p>I worked on improving the diagnosis lookup interface, which entailed a lot of fancy JavaScript (no libraries allowed!), some C#, and usability testing with local physicians.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>This one deserves its own <a href="/duolingo">review</a>. In short, I started and finished the French and Spanish tracks on Duolingo, covering 3419 words along the way. I've spent nearly 100 hours on the site already.</p>
<p>One of the contenders for "most covered song of all time" is <em>My Way</em> by Frank Sinatra, but did you know that <em>My Way</em> is itself a lyrically bastardized cover of the 1967 song <em>Comme d'habitude</em>? Or that the third-best selling secular book of all time is <em>The Little Prince</em>? Every French kid has read <em>Le Petit Prince</em>, but far fewer Americans have made the acquaintance of such memorable lines as <em title="It's the time you've wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.">"C'est le temps que tu as perdu pour ta rose qui fait ta rose si importante"</em> in either English or French.</p>
<p>Can't wait for Duolingo to add Mandarin and Thai to their lineup.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>I finally finished the transformation of this website's appearance from an incomplete, <a href="/img/old-website.png" data-lightbox="lightbox" title="Gross.">blindness-inducing eyesore</a> into something I can live with. Decent design is much harder than it looks. For anyone interested in the more technical details, check out the <a href="/colophon">list of all technologies</a> currently used in this site.</p>

<p>Continuing the financial decision engineering research work at UVa with my roommate, my summer contributions mainly took the form of optimizations and refactoring. If all goes as planned, the paper will be coming to a journal near you in early 2014.</p>

<p>I also got around to open-sourcing a bunch of old programs that I made back in high school for fun: <a href="/calculator">Calculator Blackjack and Simon</a>, <a href="https://github.com/artnc/midimeter">Midimeter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/artnc/pentris">Pentris</a>.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/artnc">Keyboards</a> and tubas are both somewhat larger than carry-on size, and my apartment for the summer had banned musical instruments anyway due to the noise. I settled with practicing fingerstyle guitar on an un-amped, solid body electric for 58 hours total. I'm still less than amazing and can only play simple arrangements like <a href="http://youtu.be/q_dKb3hmAYE">this</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/MseYTD5XYDQ">this</a>, but at least I'm better than I was three months ago.</p>
<p>Band camp will make up the last week of my summer. Definitely looking forward to jumping around with a 30 pound sousaphone on my shoulder for several hours a day! Heavy metal shall be played both literally and figuratively at the same time.</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>I worked out every day in 11th grade, but the pace gradually slowed down until I picked it up again this year. Hundreds of chin-ups, thousands of tuck planche push-ups, and varying amounts of other less fun exercises all added up to over 60000 points on <a href="https://www.fitocracy.com/profile/artnc/">Fitocracy</a> this summer. Some more numbers:</p>

<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>While never wholly unproductive, my previous summer breaks involved plenty of meme websites, EV-trained Pok&eacute;mon, and TV talent shows. If you try taking a break from distracting yourself, though, you'll find more time on your hands than you know what to do with - unless you know what to do with it.</p>

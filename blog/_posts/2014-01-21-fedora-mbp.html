<p>I recently came into ownership of a late-2013 MacBook Pro with Retina display. About an hour every morning of my first week with this laptop was spent extinguishing Linux fires that had somehow sprung up overnight. This post is a summary of the progress I've made on these issues in roughly decreasing order of importance. Not everything works as well as I'd like yet, so watch this space for updates.</p>

<h2>WiFi doesn't work</h2>

<p>You need to download wireless drivers from the Internet to get wireless working, but the MBP doesn't have an ethernet port. Bit of a catch-22. Unless you have an ethernet-to-USB adapter lying around, the easiest way to get a temporary connection is to tether from your smartphone via USB.</p>

<p>Once connected, run <code>sudo yum install kmod-wl</code> and then reboot. I had to also run <code>modprobe wl</code> afterward. Wireless should work now.</p>

<p>You can alternatively install akmod-wl instead of kmod-wl if you want. The difference is that kmod drivers are tied to kernel versions, while akmod drivers are recompiled as necessary on boot. Since I'm (probably irrationally) wary of compiling stuff locally, I go the kmod route. The downside is that kmod drivers are typically released a few days after the corresponding kernel version. If you use kmod-wl, just remember to select the second-newest kernel version from the GRUB boot menu until the appropriate kmod-wl update is available.</p>

<h2>Stuck at Fedora logo after resume</h2>

<p>Occasionally when I wake up my computer, I'm stuck with the same splash screen that appears during boot. <a href="https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/38246/fedora-logo-displayed-after-suspendresume/">This question</a> gives a pretty accurate description of the problem.</p>

<p>It's possible to get to the desktop by switching to a TTY via Ctrl+Alt+F2, logging in, running <code>sudo pkill X</code>, and switching back via Ctrl+Alt+F1. Note that by default, MBP function keys are swapped with media keys; you may actually need to do Ctrl+Alt+Fn+F2 and Ctrl+Alt+Fn+F1. This method is hardly better than simply rebooting though, since it wipes out all of your previously open windows.</p>

<p>Some suggested workarounds are to run <code>plymouth --quit</code> in the TTY or even uninstall Plymouth completely, but I haven't yet had the opportunity to test these out myself. (Plymouth is the splash screen program.)</p>

<h2>Function keys and media keys are switched</h2>

<p>On most keyboards, pressing F5 refreshes the page and pressing Fn+F5 increases the screen brightness or whatever. This is reversed on the MBP, which I would venture to guess is against your preference if you're the kind of masochist who installs Fedora on Apple hardware. You can fix it by adding <code>echo 2 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode</code> to a startup script that runs as root.</p>

<h2>Tapping the touchpad doesn't generate a left-click</h2>

<p>Run <code>synclient TapButton1=1</code>. This effect isn't permanent, so you should add it to a startup script.</p>

<h2>Thunderbolt ports don't work</h2>

<p>Well they supposedly do, but you need to have everything connected before booting Linux. Hot-plugging doesn't work.</p>

<h2>Webcam doesn't work (and isn't going to)</h2>

<p>The Linux kernel version 3.0+ includes the driver for Apple's iSight camera. Unfortunately, newer Apple laptops have a so-called FaceTime HD camera instead, listed as "Broadcom Corporation Device 1570" by <code>lspci</code>.</p>

<p>I've scoured the interwebs fairly thoroughly and despite one dubious <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1139257#p1139257">report</a> to the contrary, it seems that FaceTime HD camera support on Linux just doesn't exist yet. The Arch wiki <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBookPro11,x#Web_cam">agrees</a>.</p>

<h2>Red light in headphone jack always on</h2>

<p>Some people have had luck with <code>amixer set IEC958 off</code>. I haven't. The red light wastes a few electrons but is otherwise harmless.</p>

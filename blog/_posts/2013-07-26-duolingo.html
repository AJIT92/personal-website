<p>Yesterday I finished <a href="http://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>'s French and Spanish tracks after roughly 70 hours on the site. At the time of writing, that's 3419 words spread across <a href="http://www.duolingo.com/artnc">132 units</a>.</p>

<p>There already exist many, many articles (and even <a href="http://static.duolingo.com/s3/DuolingoReport_Final.pdf">academic papers</a>) that explain the site's features and evaluate its effectiveness. I'll therefore focus on my own experience and, in particular, what's currently lacking in the literature: exactly what results you can expect after <em>completely exhausting</em> these two language offerings.</p>

<h2>The Experience - L'Exp&eacute;rience - La Experiencia</h2>

<p>This spring semester at UVa, I took Theory of Computation with Gabriel Robins. One of his literally hundreds of extra credit opportunities was to check out the TED talk in which CMU professor Luis von Ahn announced Duolingo.</p>

<p>A quick recap of this summer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>April 23: I make a Duolingo account immediately after watching the video. Having already taken two years of Spanish in high school, I figure it'd be fun to start a new language like French.</li>
  <li>June 22: I finish French after roughly 40 hours on the site. After dabbling in German for a few hours, I try out Spanish. I learned enough from high school to place out of the first 40% of the Spanish skill tree.</li>
  <li>July 25: I finish Spanish after about 15 hours. An additional 10 hours had been devoted to keeping French fresh throughout July.</li>
</ul>

{% comment %}<p>Other than my prior exposure to Spanish, the main reason it took so much less time than French was that it's just an easier language to learn. The rules for Spanish pronunciation and spelling are dead simple, and its grammar is closer to that of English.</p>{% endcomment %}

<h2>Supplements - Suppl&eacute;ments - Suplementos</h2>

<p>Hopefully anyone who wants to actually learn a new language&mdash;instead of merely completing its Duolingo skill tree&mdash;will find the following resources as helpful as I have.</p>

<p>French:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://french.about.com/">French section</a> of About.com is extremely comprehensive and updated almost daily. It's written entirely by one person, giving it a nice sense of coherence.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MrRudylopez2000">MrRudylopez2000</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/frenchrescue">frenchrescue</a> post bilingually subtitled music videos on YouTube. There's also an abridged audiobook version of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mVBaKd45jk">Le Petit Prince</a> (The Little Prince), which is pretty much the best book ever.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKIZUyZLfsE">Muzzy</a>!</li>
</ul>

<p>Spanish:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.studyspanish.com/">StudySpanish</a> explains all the conjugation rules that Duolingo doesn't. In other words, all of them. If any of the later Duolingo verb units seems opaque, you'll invariably find someone in the comments pointing to the relevant page on StudySpanish.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MrRudylopez2000">MrRudylopez2000</a> also provides Spanish subtitles for his videos in addition to English and French.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Rcrp4xajA">Muzzy</a>! Don't be put off by the Russian title.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this will save some poor soul from many more hours of frustration. Please note that this is for Kinect for Windows, not the regular Xbox Kinect.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Remove whatever versions of OpenNI and SensorKinect you may already have on your computer.</li>
  <li>Install the <a href="http://pointclouds.org/downloads/windows.html">patched version</a> of OpenNI 1.5.4 from PCL.</li>
  <li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect/tree/unstable/Bin">latest version</a> of SensorKinect from avin2.</li>
  <li>Install the latest <a href="http://www.openni.org/openni-sdk/">unstable version</a> of OpenNI 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>This method worked today on my 64-bit Windows 7 laptop (official Kinect SDK not installed). No guarantees that it'll work for much longer...</p>

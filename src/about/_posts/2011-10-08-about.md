Hello! I'm a software engineer at [Duolingo](http://www.duolingo.com/), where I lead development of the API backend and the flagship apps for web and Windows.
 (See also: [résumé](/files/ArtChaidarun-WebResume.pdf))

I spend my free time learning new coding topics, hacking on personal projects, dabbling in piano and guitar, lifting things up, putting them down again, and catching unsuspecting Pokémon. Currently in Pittsburgh.

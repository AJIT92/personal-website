Hello world! I'm a software engineer at [Duolingo](http://www.duolingo.com/), where I lead development of the API backend and the flagship apps for web and Windows. Previously I was an Echols Scholar at the University of Virginia, graduating at 19 with majors in CS and math. More info in [résumé](/files/ArtChaidarun-WebResume.pdf).

I spend my free time learning new coding topics, hacking on personal projects, playing piano and guitar, lifting things up, putting them back down, and sleeping more than is probably healthy. Currently in Pittsburgh.

Hello world! I'm a software engineer at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and formerly [Duolingo](http://www.duolingo.com/), where I wrote (or rewrote) the API backend, the flagship web app, the flagship Windows app, and the [DET](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/) web app. More in [résumé](/files/ArtChaidarun-WebResume.pdf).

I spend my spare time learning new things, hacking on personal projects, playing guitar and piano, lifting things up, putting them back down, and writing the occasional blog post. Currently in San Francisco.

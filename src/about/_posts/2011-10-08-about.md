Hello world! I'm a software engineer at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and formerly [Duolingo](http://www.duolingo.com/), where I wrote (or rewrote) the flagship apps for web and Windows, the [DET](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/) web app, and the API backend. More in [résumé](/files/ArtChaidarun-WebResume.pdf).

I spend my spare time learning new things, hacking on personal projects, playing guitar and piano, lifting things up, putting them back down, and writing the occasional blog post. Currently in San Francisco.

The highest-numbered undergrad CS elective offered at UVa is [CS 4810](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~gfx/Courses/2012/IntroGraphics/schedule.html), Introduction to Computer Graphics. Its transparent grading policy, rewarding results, and unforgivingly mathematical nature made it a fun challenge and certainly the most worthwhile class I've ever taken.

Sixty percent of the final grade was determined by three fairly intense C++ programming assignments, which were each accompanied by an extra-credit [art contest](http://people.virginia.edu/~sj6re/Fall2012CS4810.html) that required entries to be generated using the programs themselves. I won all three contests; my submissions are below (click to enlarge/animate).

Morphing and crossfading in the first two entries were achieved using hardcoded sets of control lines and the Beier-Neely algorithm, famously featured in the [music video](http://youtu.be/tyBs6-cmFvQ?t=3m36s) for Michael Jackson's *Black or White*.

I can't take 100% of the credit for these results, though. The professor did provide students with some precooked resources: header files, matrix arithmetic functions*, and a basic I/O framework. Our job was to make sense of how the given classes were supposed to interact with each other, write their methods in accordance with the Phong reflection model, construct scene data files by hand, and attempt to debug visual defects using little more than `std::cout` and patience.

**I actually found a rather egregious [bug](/files/gfx2/nc5rk#bug) in the provided routine for ray transformation in homogeneous coordinates that caused all normals on one side of an arbitrary plane to be reversed. I'm guessing that such a showstopper remained unfixed for multiple semesters only because we were explicitly told not to modify the matrix library (although to his credit, my professor probably wasn't the one who wrote the code he gave us).*

  var img1 = new Image(),
    img2 = new Image();
    img3 = new Image();
  img1.src = "/files/gfx1/nc5rk_HTML/nc5rk.art.1.gif";
  img2.src = "/files/gfx2/nc5rk_HTML/nc5rk.art.1.gif";
  img3.src = "/files/gfx3/nc5rk_HTML/nc5rk.art.1.png";
</script>

<p>Nearly all of my sheet music is in PDF. I'm usually too <span style="text-decoration:line-through">lazy</span>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:line-through">cheap</span> environmentally conscious to print it out, and sadly there are only so many notes that can fit on a screen. My playing has traditionally been littered with impromptu rest measures during which I reach for the mouse to scroll down.</p>
<p>Last night I hacked together a little program that allows you to send PageUp and PageDown keypresses by tilting your head. For now, it runs only on Linux and detects only human faces.</p>

<div class="text-centered">
  <img alt="OpenCV page turner" src="/img/page-turner.png">
</div>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Make sure you have the required libraries.</p>
{% highlight shell %}
# Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev python-opencv

# Fedora:
sudo yum install opencv-devel opencv-python
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Get the <a href="https://github.com/artnc/opencv-page-turner">code</a>.</p>
{% highlight shell %}
git clone https://github.com/artnc/opencv-page-turner.git
cd opencv-page-turner
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Run it!</p>
{% highlight shell %}
python pageturner.py
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Tilting your head to the left sends a PageUp keypress to the active window; tilting to the right sends PageDown. Run the program, open your sheet music in a PDF reader, and start playing.</p>
<p>Note that this page turner's reliance on subtle head movements discourages a physically expressive style of play&mdash;sorry, Lang Lang.</p>

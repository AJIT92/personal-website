The guitalele is a small guitar built like a ukulele, and it should be your next -- or even first -- musical instrument.

For rough comparison with any instruments you might already play, here are my subjective and flamebaity ratings of several instruments' different qualities:

The guitalele does earn the most stars here, but that's a pretty crude heuristic. To elaborate, you should get a guitalele already...

## Because it's fun

Some instruments, like violin, are culturally very serious and competitive. Others, like sousaphone, are utterly ridiculous and more about showmanship than musicality. The guitalele inherits a casual, friendly attitude from its ukulele roots.

Its six strings are tuned ADGCEA, which is non-coincidentally equivalent to capoing a regular guitar at the 5th fret. If you can play guitar, you already know how to play guitalele! The familiar fingering and small size make it even more conducive to passing around a campfire than a guitar is.

For newcomers to stringed instruments, the guitalele provides another easily overlooked benefit: its low-tension strings won't hurt your fingers.

## Because it's versatile

A major reason why guitar and piano are so popular is that you can play multiple notes at the same time (polyphony). Unlike wind instruments, they also allow you to sing along and -- in the case of guitar -- use percussive techniques like tapping and slapping. This all adds up to the ability to play virtually any song on a guitalele without the need for accompaniment.

## Because it's portable

As my go-to travel instrument, my guitalele has joined me on trips to Mexico, Hawaii, Costa Rica, and Thailand. Ukulele lookalikes are especially appropriate in tropical locations :)

A guitalele can fit easily in an overhead bin and, in a pinch, underneath the seat in front of you. Flight attendants generally don't mind either way.

My one (minor) gripe about guitaleles is that they're only slightly louder than ukuleles and can be hard to hear in loud environments. That's not an entirely bad thing, though! I can practice during layovers without bothering anyone, whereas I still have yet to find a place soundproofed enough for sax.

## Because it's cheap

$100 is way down on the low end as far as musical instruments go, making it a responsible investment for musical newcomers. Only "toy" instruments like recorders and diatonic harmonicas are significantly cheaper.

My guitalele has far and away the lowest cost per hour over its lifetime of any instrument I've played, and yet it's still in great condition after three years.

## Because it's easy

If you want to start playing music but don't have a ton of time to invest in practicing, you really only need to learn [four chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%E2%80%93V%E2%80%93vi%E2%80%93IV_progression) in order to play [most pop songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I). Unless you have huge hands, you'll also probably find the widest frets on the guitalele more comfortable to hold down than on a regular guitar.

Once you get tired of strumming the beginner chords, you can start the long journey of learning more colorful guitar techniques like bends, harmonics, and tremolo picking.

Another advantage over wind instruments in particular is that you can just pick up a guitalele and put it down without the ritualistic hassle of assembling, greasing, wiping, and draining.

## OK, where's the affiliate link...

Believe it or not, I have no ties to Yamaha and wasn't paid to write this! No Amazon affiliate links here either :)

Having finally found an instrument that's both extremely fun and extremely practical, I hope this review can help end that search for anyone else considering a guitalele.
